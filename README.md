# Module-10-Challenge
Module 10 Challenge of Fintech Bootcamp

For this challenge, I created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.

## High-Level Steps
Import the data (provided in the starter code).

Prepare the data  (provided in the starter code).

Find the best value for k by using the original data.

Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the original data.

Optimize the clusters with principal component analysis.

Find the best value for k by using the PCA data.

Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means by using the PCA data.

Visualize and compare the results.

## Files
In the Starter_Code folder you will find the jupyter notebook named crypto_investments.ipynb.

There is also a Resources folder containing the crypto_market_data.csv file provided to complete this challenge.

## Libraries
* Pandas for creating DataFrames.
* Pathlib for reading the .csv file.
* sklearn for applying KMeans, PCA and StandardScaler
